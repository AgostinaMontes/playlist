        <p>I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh<br>
        Every moment takes me to paradise<br>
        Darling, let me hold you<br>
        I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away<br>
        Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make<br>
        I need you night and day</p>

        <p>So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)<br>
        And girl I'll give you all I got to give<br>
        So baby, be my girl (All the time)<br>
        And we can share this ecstasy<br>
        As long as we believe in love</p>

        <p> I won't give you reason to change your mind<br>
        (I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)<br>
        You are all the future that I desire<br>
        Girl, I need to hold you<br>
        Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace<br>
        Show you all the passion burning in my heart today<br>
        It's never going to fade</p>

        <p>So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine)<br>
        And girl I'll give you all I got to give<br>
        So baby, be my girl (All the time)<br>
        You're everything this world could be<br>
        The reason that I live, oh</p>

        <p>Won't you stay with me until the morning sun<br>
        I promise you now that the dawn will be different<br>
        Lady can't you see that heaven's just begun<br>
        It's living here inside our hearts</p>

        <p>There'll be no more mountains for us to climb<br>
        (I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)<br>
        This will be a love lasting for all time<br>
        Girl, you got to hold me<br>
        We can touch the sky and light the darkest day<br>
        Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way<br>
        There's no more I can say</p>

        <p>So baby, be mine (Baby be mine, baby you got to be mine)<br>
        And girl I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)<br>
        So baby, be my girl (All the time, show me how it should be, hold me tight)<br>
        You're everything this world could be (Every night)<br>
        The reason that I live (It's alright, every night)</p>

        <p>Baby, be my girl (Tell me that you love me, all the time)<br>
        And girl I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)<br>
        So baby, be mine, baby, be mine (Show me how it should be, hold me tight)<br>
        You're everything this world could be to me (Every night, it's alright)</p>
