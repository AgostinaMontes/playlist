        <p>What about sunrise<br>
        What about rain<br>
        What about all the things that you said<br>
        We were to gain<br>
        What about killing fields<br>
        Is there a time<br>
        What about all the things<br>
        That you said were yours and mine</p>

        <p>Did you ever stop to notice<br>
        All the blood we've shed before<br>
        Did you ever stop to notice<br>
        This crying Earth, these weeping shores</p>

        <p>Aah, ooh</p>

        <p>What have we done to the world<br>
        Look what we've done<br>
        What about all the peace<br>
        That you pledge your only son</p>

        <p>What about flowering fields<br>
        Is there a time<br>
        What about all the dreams<br>
        That you said was yours and mine</p>

        <p>Did you ever stop to notice<br>
        All the children dead from war<br>
        Did you ever stop to notice<br>
        This crying earth, these weeping shores</p>

        <p>Aah, ooh<br>
        Aah, ooh</p>

        <p>I used to dream<br>
        I used to glance beyond the stars<br>
        Now I don't know where we are<br>
        Although I know we've drifted far</p>

        <p>Aah, ooh<br>
        Aah, ooh<br>
        Aah, ooh<br>
        Aah, ooh</p>

        <p>Hey, what about yesterday<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        What about the seas<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        The heavens are falling down<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        I can't even breathe<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        What about apathy<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        Drowning in the seas<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        What about the promised land<br>
        Preachin' what I believe<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        What about the holy land<br>
        (What about it)<br>
        What about the greed<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        Where did we go wrong<br>
        Someone tell me why<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        What about baby boy<br>
        (What about him)<br>
        What about the days<br>
        (What about us)<br>
        What about all their joy<br>
        Do we give a damn</p>

        <p>Aah, ooh<br>
        Aah, ooh</p>
