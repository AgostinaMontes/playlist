        <p>What about sunrise?<br>
        What about rain?<br>
        What about all the things<br>
        That you said we were to gain?</p><br>

        All the blood we've shed before?<br>
        Did you ever stop to notice<br>
        This crying Earth, these weeping shores?</p>

        <p>I used to dream<br>
        I used to glance beyond the stars<br>
        Now I don't know where we are<br>
