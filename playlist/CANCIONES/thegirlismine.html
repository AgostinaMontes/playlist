        <p>Every night she walks right in my dreams<br>
        Since I met her from the start<br>
        I'm so proud I am the only one<br>
        Who is special in her heart</p>

        <p>The girl is mine<br>
        The doggone girl is mine<br>
        I know she's mine<br>
        Because the doggone girl is mine</p>

        <p>I don't understand the way you think<br>
        Saying that she's yours not mine<br>
        Sending roses and your silly dreams<br>
        Really just a waste of time</p>

        <p>Because she's mine<br>
        The doggone girl is mine<br>
        Don't waste your time<br>
        Because the doggone girl is mine</p>

        <p>I love you more than he<br>
        (Take you anywhere)<br>
        Well, I love you endlessly<br>
        (Loving we will share)<br>
        So come and go with me<br>
        To one's town</p>

        <p>But we both cannot have her<br>
        So it's one or the other<br>
        And one day you'll discover<br>
        That she's my girl forever and ever</p>

        <p>Don't build your hopes to be let down<br>
        'Cause I really feel it's time<br>
        I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her<br>
        'Cause she said I blow her mind</p>

        <p>The girl is mine<br>
        The doggone girl is mine<br>
        Don't waste your time<br>
        Because the doggone girl is mine</p>

        <p>She's mine, she's mine<br>
        No, no, no, she's mine<br>
        The girl is mine, the girl is mine<br>
        The girl is mine, the girl is mine<br>
        The girl is mine (mine, mine)<br>
        Yep, she's mine (mine, mine)<br>
        The girl is mine (mine, mine)<br>
        Yeah, she's mine (mine, mine)</p>

        <p>Don't waste your time<br>
        Because the doggone girl is mine<br>
        The girl is mine, the girl is mine</p>

        <p>Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?<br>
        Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter<br>
        I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover<br>
        You know, don't you remember?<br>
        Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another<br>
        Is that what she said?<br>
        Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming</p>

        <p>I don't believe it (mine, mine)<br>
        The girl is mine (mine, mine)<br>
        No, mine<br>
        She's mine, mine, mine (mine, mine, mine, mine)<br>
        'Cause the girl is mine (mine, mine)<br>
        The girl is mine (mine, mine)<br>
        Girl is mine...</p>
